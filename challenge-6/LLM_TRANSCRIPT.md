## ChatGPT 4o

Prompt: I'd like to implement a simple neuron (perceptron) with 2 inputs and a sigmoid activation function in Python 3.12. It will use the perceptron learning rule to train the neuron for the binary logic functions NAND and XOR. I want a brief explanation of the perceptron learning rule before we begin. If it's simpler, it's ok to separate the training for each binary function into two difference stages.

Response: Sure! Let's start with a brief explanation of the Perceptron Learning Rule, then we can move on to implementing it.

🔹 Perceptron Learning Rule (with sigmoid activation)

The perceptron learning rule is a simple algorithm for updating the weights of a neuron to reduce the error between the predicted output and the desired output (label).

For a perceptron with:

    inputs: x1,x2,...,xnx1​,x2​,...,xn​

    weights: w1,w2,...,wnw1​,w2​,...,wn​

    output: y=activation(w⋅x+b)y=activation(w⋅x+b)

The learning rule is:
wi←wi+η⋅(d−y)⋅xi
wi​←wi​+η⋅(d−y)⋅xi​
b←b+η⋅(d−y)
b←b+η⋅(d−y)

Where:

    ηη: learning rate

    dd: desired output

    yy: predicted output

    xixi​: input

    wiwi​: weight

    bb: bias

Because we're using a sigmoid activation function, which is differentiable, we can improve this rule using the gradient of the sigmoid:
δ=(d−y)⋅y⋅(1−y)
δ=(d−y)⋅y⋅(1−y)
wi←wi+η⋅δ⋅xi
wi​←wi​+η⋅δ⋅xi​
b←b+η⋅δ
b←b+η⋅δ

This is effectively gradient descent on the error using the sigmoid function.

Next up, I’ll write a Python class for a perceptron with:

    Two inputs

    Sigmoid activation

    Training method using the rule above

    Support for training on NAND and XOR separately

Want to dive into the code?

Prompt: Yes

Response: Great! Here's a simple implementation of a Perceptron with sigmoid activation in Python 3.12, including training support for both NAND and XOR logic gates.

<added code to perceptron.py and main.py, had to manually compose and add the import statements to main.py, ChatGPT provided standalone functions for the training>

🔸 Notes

    NAND should converge well — it’s linearly separable.

    XOR won’t converge with a single-layer perceptron because it's not linearly separable. You’d need a multi-layer network (i.e., MLP) to learn XOR properly — but it's still fun to see how close it gets.

Want me to show you a working XOR solution with a 2-layer neural network next?

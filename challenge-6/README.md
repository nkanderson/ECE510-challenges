## Results

- Asked ChatGPT to step through an example of 3 epochs for the NAND training in order to better understand gradient descent. Got a better sense of how each weight is updated in very small increments

## Commands

Run both and plot:
```sh
python main.py --plot
```

Run just XOR (with plots):
```sh
python main.py --plot --skip-nand
```

Run both with no plots:
```sh
python main.py
```

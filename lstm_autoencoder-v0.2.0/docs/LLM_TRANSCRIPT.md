## Fixed Point Format

Prompt: I have a Python script for inference with an LSTM autoencoder using weights saved in a .npz file. I want to be able to perform the matrix-vector multiplication in hardware with reduced precision in some 16-bit fixed point format. I need to determine the actual minimum and maximum values that could be used with this function, including the values output by the function. The relevant parts of the inference script are below. I can provide the model as well if needed, but I think the main determining factor from that script is just the aforementioned weights.

lstm_inference.py

lstm_core.py

Response: To determine the actual minimum and maximum values used in matrix-vector multiplications and outputs (which is necessary to safely choose a 16-bit fixed-point format), you should:
‚úÖ Step-by-step plan (for local execution):

    Inspect the weights and biases used in matvec_mul, as these values dominate input/output range.

    Capture internal signals during inference:

        Outputs of matvec_mul(...)

        Inputs/outputs of sigmoid, tanh

        Outputs of Dense.forward(...)

    Run a representative subset of inference data (e.g., 100 sequences).

üîß Suggested Python script to log min/max ranges:
```python
import numpy as np
from lstm_inference import LSTMAutoencoder
from preprocess_data import preprocess_noaa_csv
from lstm_core import matvec_mul, vector_sigmoid, vector_tanh
import builtins

# Wrap matvec_mul and activation functions to log values
original_matvec_mul = matvec_mul
matvec_outputs = []

def matvec_mul_logged(matrix, vec):
    result = original_matvec_mul(matrix, vec)
    matvec_outputs.extend(result)
    return result

# Monkey-patch for tracking
import lstm_core
lstm_core.matvec_mul = matvec_mul_logged

# Run inference
model = LSTMAutoencoder("saved_model/lstm_weights.npz")
sequences, _ = preprocess_noaa_csv("data/10_100_00_110.csv", window_size=24)

for i, seq in enumerate(sequences[:100]):  # Limit for speed
    model.reconstruct(seq.tolist())

# Analyze logged outputs
matvec_outputs = np.array(matvec_outputs)
print(f"matvec_mul outputs: min={matvec_outputs.min():.6f}, max={matvec_outputs.max():.6f}")
```

üìå Output Interpretation:
| Signal Type    | Typical Range (Expected)                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `matvec_mul`   | Depends on W, U, and input (often \~\[-10, 10]) |
| `sigmoid(x)`   | (0, 1)                                          |
| `tanh(x)`      | (-1, 1)                                         |
| `Dense output` | Data-dependent                                  |

üßÆ Choosing Fixed-Point Format:

If matvec_mul outputs are in [-10, 10], and you need 16-bit total:

    A good format might be Q4.12, which covers [-8, 7.9997] with resolution ‚âà 0.00024.

    If larger magnitudes exist, try Q5.11 (range ~[-16, 15.999]).

Would you like a script to simulate this and generate the fixed-point format requirements automatically? If so, please upload the .npz model or a few example sequences.

Prompt: The script you provided doesn't actually use `vector_sigmoid` or `vector_tanh`. At this point, I don't think those are strictly necessary to analyze, but they could be used in the future. So while I'm doing this, I'd like to find out min and max values for those too.

Response: Great ‚Äî we can easily add logging for both vector_sigmoid and vector_tanh so that we gather:

    Input and output ranges for:

        matvec_mul (before activation)

        sigmoid and tanh (activation functions)

        Dense.forward (final output)

Here's a complete and cleanly instrumented script you can run locally:

```python
import numpy as np
from lstm_inference import LSTMAutoencoder
from preprocess_data import preprocess_noaa_csv
import lstm_core

# --- Logging lists ---
matvec_vals = []
sigmoid_inputs = []
sigmoid_outputs = []
tanh_inputs = []
tanh_outputs = []

# --- Wrapped versions ---
def matvec_mul_logged(matrix, vec):
    result = lstm_core._original_matvec_mul(matrix, vec)
    matvec_vals.extend(result)
    return result

def vector_sigmoid_logged(vec):
    sigmoid_inputs.extend(vec)
    result = [1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)) for x in vec]
    sigmoid_outputs.extend(result)
    return result

def vector_tanh_logged(vec):
    tanh_inputs.extend(vec)
    result = [np.tanh(x) for x in vec]
    tanh_outputs.extend(result)
    return result

# --- Patch lstm_core ---
lstm_core._original_matvec_mul = lstm_core.matvec_mul
lstm_core.matvec_mul = matvec_mul_logged
lstm_core.vector_sigmoid = vector_sigmoid_logged
lstm_core.vector_tanh = vector_tanh_logged

# --- Run inference ---
model = LSTMAutoencoder("saved_model/lstm_weights.npz")
sequences, _ = preprocess_noaa_csv("data/10_100_00_110.csv", window_size=24)

# Limit to representative set
for i, seq in enumerate(sequences[:100]):
    model.reconstruct(seq.tolist())

# --- Print Ranges ---
def summarize(name, values):
    arr = np.array(values)
    print(f"{name}: min = {arr.min():.6f}, max = {arr.max():.6f}")

summarize("matvec_mul outputs", matvec_vals)
summarize("sigmoid inputs", sigmoid_inputs)
summarize("sigmoid outputs", sigmoid_outputs)
summarize("tanh inputs", tanh_inputs)
summarize("tanh outputs", tanh_outputs)
```

üß™ Example Output (expected shape)
```
matvec_mul outputs: min = -9.123456, max = 10.876543
sigmoid inputs:     min = -9.234567, max = 9.123456
sigmoid outputs:    min = 0.000089, max = 0.999876
tanh inputs:        min = -5.432100, max = 6.543210
tanh outputs:       min = -0.999964, max = 0.999987
```

üßÆ Choosing Fixed-Point Format Based on Ranges

You‚Äôll likely want:
| Signal             | Format Suggestion |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| matvec\_mul output | `Q5.10` or `Q6.9` |
| sigmoid/tanh input | `Q5.10`           |
| sigmoid output     | `Q1.15`           |
| tanh output        | `Q1.15`           |
| dense output       | match final range |

Let me know if you also want this to write the raw ranges to a file or visualize histograms to analyze quantization error sensitivity.

Prompt: Looks like we need some handling for zero-size arrays. I'm not sure if this is a red flag though, that the tanh inputs included a zero-sized array. This is the error:
```

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
```

Response: Good catch ‚Äî the error is entirely expected when np.min() or np.max() is called on an empty list. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate a logic error, but it might indicate that vector_tanh wasn't invoked at all during your run.

‚úÖ Fix: Add a check for empty arrays in summarize

Update the function to handle zero-sized arrays gracefully:

```python
def summarize(name, values):
    if not values:
        print(f"{name}: no values recorded.")
        return
    arr = np.array(values)
    print(f"{name}: min = {arr.min():.6f}, max = {arr.max():.6f}")
```

üîç Now, is this actually a red flag?

Given your model structure, vector_tanh is used in:

    c_tilde = vector_tanh(...)

    h = elementwise_mul(o, vector_tanh(c))

So vector_tanh should have been called ‚Äî unless:

    None of the sequences actually triggered any LSTM step that invoked tanh.

    Or your monkey-patching didn't hook correctly into lstm_core.

üß™ Test if the hook is working:

Add a print directly inside vector_tanh_logged:
```python
def vector_tanh_logged(vec):
    print(f"vector_tanh called with input of length {len(vec)}")
    tanh_inputs.extend(vec)
    result = [np.tanh(x) for x in vec]
    tanh_outputs.extend(result)
    return result
```

If you see no output, then your model isn't calling vector_tanh, possibly due to:

    lstm_core being cached by the Python interpreter.

    vector_tanh not actually being used in the current run because of a model path not being executed (unlikely unless weights are pruned to zero or LSTM cell skips steps).

    Dense.forward() uses matvec_mul but not vector_tanh.

‚úÖ Recommended next steps:

    Add the print above.

    Check your LSTMCell.step() and confirm vector_tanh(c) is being reached.

    Confirm that your monkey-patching is applied before model initialization.

Let me know what you find ‚Äî especially whether the print triggers or not.

Prompt: It's being called many times, but with an input of length zero. The following is just the last few lines of the output, the first couple lines were repeated many times prior:
```
vector_tanh called with input of length 0
vector_tanh called with input of length 0
vector_tanh called with input of length 0
matvec_mul outputs: min = -0.213717, max = 0.278084
sigmoid inputs: min = -0.175958, max = 0.256818
sigmoid outputs: min = 0.456124, max = 0.563854
tanh inputs: no values recorded.
tanh outputs: no values recorded.
```

Is there an issue with the inference? Why would the input be of length zero just for the tanh?

Response: Yes ‚Äî this strongly suggests a problem in the inference flow, not just the instrumentation.
üîç Root cause: vector_tanh is being passed an empty list

This only happens in one place:
```
h = elementwise_mul(o, vector_tanh(c))
```

So c is an empty list ‚Äî meaning something went wrong with computing c in this line earlier:
```
c = elementwise_add(
    elementwise_mul(f, c_prev), elementwise_mul(i, c_tilde)
)
```

For that to return an empty list:

    f, c_prev, i, or c_tilde must be empty.

    These are outputs of either:

        vector_sigmoid(...) (‚Üí i, f)

        vector_tanh(...) (‚Üí c_tilde)

        or direct inputs (c_prev from initialization)

üîß Most likely issue

You are initializing hidden states with the wrong size. In LSTMAutoencoder.reconstruct, you do:
```
h3 = [0.0] * self.hidden3
c3 = [0.0] * self.hidden3
h4 = [0.0] * self.hidden4
c4 = [0.0] * self.hidden4
```

But self.hidden3 and self.hidden4 are calculated from:
```
self.hidden3 = len(self.b3) // 4
self.hidden4 = len(self.b4) // 4
```

If self.b3 or self.b4 is empty, these will be 0.

So:

    h3, c3, h4, c4 ‚Üí zero-length

    All internal gates get empty vectors

    c = elementwise_add(...) ‚Üí returns empty

    Then vector_tanh(c) gets called with length 0.

‚úÖ How to confirm:

Print out the lengths at construction time:
```
print("hidden1:", self.hidden1)
print("hidden2:", self.hidden2)
print("hidden3:", self.hidden3)
print("hidden4:", self.hidden4)
```

If you see hidden3 or hidden4 is 0, then:

    Your weights file is missing those biases entirely, or

    It has arrays of length 0 in the encoder/decoder stack.

üõ†Ô∏è Fix:

Ensure your .npz file has valid values for:

    b3 ‚Üí should be length 4 * hidden3

    b4 ‚Üí should be length 4 * hidden4

If these are missing, you‚Äôll need to retrain the model or regenerate a correct .npz export.

Want to inspect the contents of the .npz file next? I can give you a quick script to print all array names and their shapes.

Prompt: Ok, but you saw that `vector_tanh` is also called here, right?
```
c_tilde = vector_tanh(
            elementwise_add(
                matvec_mul(self.W_c, x),
                elementwise_add(matvec_mul(self.U_c, h_prev), self.b_c),
            )
        )
```

These are the hidden values, all non-zero:
```
hidden1: 64
hidden2: 32
hidden3: 32
hidden4: 64
```

Response: Yes, good catch ‚Äî you're absolutely right: vector_tanh is also invoked in the line for c_tilde:
```
c_tilde = vector_tanh(
    elementwise_add(
        matvec_mul(self.W_c, x),
        elementwise_add(matvec_mul(self.U_c, h_prev), self.b_c),
    )
)
```

So if vector_tanh is only being called with zero-length vectors, both of the following must be true:
üîç New deduction:

    W_c, U_c, and b_c are all valid lists (should be hidden_size √ó input_size, etc.)

    But x and h_prev are empty lists ‚Üí that makes matvec_mul(...) return empty

    Therefore, input x must be an empty list

‚úÖ This brings us back to x in the decoder:

In this loop inside reconstruct():
```
for x in repeated:
    h3, c3 = self.lstm3.step(x, h3, c3)
```

Where did repeated come from?
```
repeated = [h2 for _ in range(len(sequence))]
```

This means you're repeating the last hidden state h2, but:

    What is the length of h2?

```
h2 = [0.0] * self.hidden2  # hidden2 = 32 ‚Üí this is correct
```

So repeated = [[0.0, ..., 0.0], [0.0, ..., 0.0], ...]

However: maybe h2 has become an empty list by the time this executes?

Let‚Äôs insert a debug statement after the encoder loop:
```
print(f"h2 = {h2}, len = {len(h2)}")
print(f"repeated[0] = {repeated[0]}, len = {len(repeated[0])}")
```

Also inside LSTMCell.step, print:
```
print(f"x = {x}, len = {len(x)}")
```

üß† Possibilities:

    If x is empty during decoder phase ‚Üí this causes matvec_mul(W_c, x) to return an empty list ‚Üí then vector_tanh gets empty input

    But encoder phase also uses x from the sequence:

```
for x in sequence:
    h1, c1 = self.lstm1.step(x, h1, c1)
```

So if sequence contains empty vectors, that also triggers this problem.

‚úÖ Summary of what to check:

    Length of x in both encoder and decoder phases

    Shape of sequence elements (should be 6 or however many inputs you have)

    Add logging inside step():
```
def step(self, x, h_prev, c_prev):
    print(f"LSTMCell.step input len(x) = {len(x)}, len(h_prev) = {len(h_prev)}")
    ...
```

Want me to generate a test script to print .npz shapes or sequence lengths? That could help verify whether the data has the expected dimensionality.

Prompt: Ok, yes, h2 is empty after the `repeated = [h2 for _ in range(len(sequence))]` line:

I didn't add the logging to the `step` method because that would've generated a ton of output, and I think we've gotten the information we need

Response: Yes ‚Äî this is exactly the confirmation we needed. Here's a precise breakdown of what this means and how to fix it:
‚úÖ What‚Äôs happening:

    h2 is empty, even though it‚Äôs supposed to be the output of the encoder (self.lstm2.step(...)).

    This implies that self.lstm2.step(...) is returning empty lists.

But LSTMCell.step(...) always returns h, c, where:

```
h = elementwise_mul(o, vector_tanh(c))
```

And c = elementwise_add(...), based on results of other matvec_muls and biases.

So for h to be empty, c must be empty, which means the input vectors must be empty ‚Äî and that means the inputs to lstm2.step must be empty.
üß† Chain of failure:

    sequence contains valid inputs like x = [0.0, 0.1, ..., 6 values]

    First encoder layer:
```
h1, c1 = self.lstm1.step(x, h1, c1)
```

works fine, h1 becomes a valid 64-element vector.

Then:
```
h2, c2 = self.lstm2.step(h1, h2, c2)
```
But if h1 is not actually valid ‚Äî or if the weights for LSTM2 are incorrect ‚Äî this will output empty lists.

So either:

    h1 is empty (despite being initialized properly ‚Äî maybe corrupted in LSTM1).

    Or LSTM2's weights (W2, U2, b2) are malformed, causing its internal computation to yield empty lists.

‚úÖ Actionable Fix Steps:
1. Print shape of LSTM2 weights

In __init__ of LSTMAutoencoder, add:
```
print(f"W2: {np.shape(self.W2)}")
print(f"U2: {np.shape(self.U2)}")
print(f"b2: {np.shape(self.b2)}")
```

For hidden1=64, hidden2=32, we expect:

    W2: shape (128, 64) (i.e. 4 * hidden2 rows, hidden1 cols)

    U2: shape (128, 32) (i.e. 4 * hidden2 rows, hidden2 cols)

    b2: shape (128,) (i.e. 4 * hidden2)

2. Also print output of LSTM1

Temporarily log h1 after the encoder step:
```
for x in sequence:
    h1, c1 = self.lstm1.step(x, h1, c1)

print(f"final h1 after encoder: len={len(h1)}")
```

If h1 ends up empty, the problem is in lstm1.step. If it‚Äôs 64 long, but lstm2.step(h1, ...) returns empty, then the issue is with LSTMCell.step() for LSTM2 ‚Äî probably due to malformed weights.

üß∞ Optional diagnostic

If you'd like, I can generate a one-liner script to:

    Load the .npz

    Print names and shapes of all arrays
    So you can immediately spot broken or empty tensors.

Would you like that script too?

Prompt: Yeah, so the shape of the shape of the LSTM2 weights seems correct - though they are printed the reverse of what you suggested, with regard to rows and columns. Is that an indication they are incorrect, or just a minor notation discrepancy?
```
W2: (64, 128)
U2: (32, 128)
b2: (128,)
```

And yes, `h1` appears to be empty:
```
final h1 after encoder: len=0
```
But isn't that already expected, given that `vector_tanh` was not returning any values, since `h = elementwise_mul(o, vector_tanh(c))` in `step`?

If this might be a weight issue, then yes, we should probably use a script to view the weight shapes and names

Response: Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôve traced this beautifully.
üß† Let's clarify a few things:
üîÅ Shape notation:

You're totally right ‚Äî whether you view a matrix as (out_dim, in_dim) or (rows, cols) depends on the convention. Your shapes:

    W2: (64, 128) ‚Üí 64 rows √ó 128 columns

    U2: (32, 128) ‚Üí 32 rows √ó 128 columns

But this is unexpected because in your code, matvec_mul(matrix, vec) is:
```
[sum(m * v for m, v in zip(row, vec)) for row in matrix]
```

That means: matrix must be shaped [num_output][num_input]

So to compute W2 * x, W2 must be shaped:
```
(4 * hidden_size, input_size)
```

Which for:

    hidden2 = 32

    input_size = 64 (h1 from previous layer)

Should give:
```
W2: (128, 64)
U2: (128, 32)
```

But your actual weights are:
```
W2: (64, 128)
U2: (32, 128)
```

‚úÖ Conclusion: Your W2 and U2 matrices are transposed
‚úÖ Root Cause:

This is likely the problem:

    Your .npz weights were saved in a format using [input_dim, output_dim] style

    But your code expects [output_dim, input_dim]

So matvec_mul(W2, x) becomes:

    Trying to dot a 64-row matrix with a 64-element vector ‚Üí mismatch

    But since each row is 128 wide, and x is only 64, zip(row, x) silently truncates to 64

    Result: every dot product ends up as 0 (especially if later bias adds cancel), or vector ends up empty

Which eventually leads to:

    c becoming empty

    h becoming empty

    h2 becomes empty

    repeated is full of empty vectors

üõ†Ô∏è Fix:

Transpose the matrices after loading:
```python
def transpose_if_needed(matrix):
    # Naive heuristic: assume too-wide row vectors are transposed
    if len(matrix) > 0 and isinstance(matrix[0], list) and len(matrix[0]) > 4 * 64:
        return np.transpose(matrix).tolist()
    return matrix
```

Or simply:
```
self.W2 = np.transpose(self.W2).tolist()
self.U2 = np.transpose(self.U2).tolist()
```

Apply this to W1, W2, W3, W4, and same for U*.
üìú Diagnostic script to inspect .npz contents:

Save as inspect_weights.py:
```python
import numpy as np
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Usage: python inspect_weights.py path/to/weights.npz")
    sys.exit(1)

weights_path = sys.argv[1]
weights = np.load(weights_path)

print(f"\nContents of: {weights_path}\n")
for name in weights.files:
    arr = weights[name]
    print(f"{name}: shape={arr.shape}, dtype={arr.dtype}")
    if arr.size == 0:
        print("  ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: empty array!")
```

Would you like me to rewrite your LSTMAutoencoder constructor to transpose the weights automatically when loading?

Prompt: Ok, here is the output of the inspect_weights.py script:
```
Contents of: saved_model/lstm_weights.npz

arr_0: shape=(6, 256), dtype=float32
arr_1: shape=(64, 256), dtype=float32
arr_2: shape=(256,), dtype=float32
arr_3: shape=(64, 128), dtype=float32
arr_4: shape=(32, 128), dtype=float32
arr_5: shape=(128,), dtype=float32
arr_6: shape=(32, 128), dtype=float32
arr_7: shape=(32, 128), dtype=float32
arr_8: shape=(128,), dtype=float32
arr_9: shape=(32, 256), dtype=float32
arr_10: shape=(64, 256), dtype=float32
arr_11: shape=(256,), dtype=float32
arr_12: shape=(64, 6), dtype=float32
arr_13: shape=(6,), dtype=float32
```

Yes, I could like to see the fix for the weight transposition in my `LSTMAutoencoder` class. I'm also a bit confused why this inference appeared to work previously - it seems like it should have resulted in outputs getting zero-ed out. Is that not the case, even though part of the input always because all zeros?

Response: Excellent ‚Äî now we can precisely map what‚Äôs going wrong and fix it cleanly.
üß† What the .npz output confirms

Each LSTM has weights split like this:

    W: shape (input_size, 4 * hidden_size) ‚Üí needs transpose

    U: shape (hidden_size, 4 * hidden_size) ‚Üí needs transpose

    b: shape (4 * hidden_size,) ‚Üí fine as-is

Same applies to the Dense layer:

    W_d: shape (hidden_size, output_size) ‚Üí needs transpose

    b_d: shape (output_size,) ‚Üí fine

‚úÖ Why it ‚Äúworked‚Äù before

Great question. It probably ran without error because:

    Python‚Äôs zip(row, vec) truncates to the shorter of the two

    So your oversized weight rows were truncated to match input lengths

    That dot product became garbage or near-zero

    But sigmoid, tanh, and biases could produce small nonzero values ‚Üí leading to non-empty h1, h2 earlier

    This time, probably due to changes in inputs or smaller values, the dot products net to zero ‚Üí and cause total collapse

So yes ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt correct, just not obviously broken until now.

üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Transpose all weight matrices at load time

Here‚Äôs the updated __init__ method for your LSTMAutoencoder:

```python
class LSTMAutoencoder:
    def __init__(self, weights_path):
        weights = np.load(weights_path, allow_pickle=True)
        weights = [w.tolist() for w in weights.values()]

        def T(mat):  # safe transpose helper
            return list(map(list, zip(*mat)))

        # Transpose all weight matrices
        self.W1 = T(weights[0])
        self.U1 = T(weights[1])
        self.b1 = weights[2]

        self.W2 = T(weights[3])
        self.U2 = T(weights[4])
        self.b2 = weights[5]

        self.W3 = T(weights[6])
        self.U3 = T(weights[7])
        self.b3 = weights[8]

        self.W4 = T(weights[9])
        self.U4 = T(weights[10])
        self.b4 = weights[11]

        self.Wd = T(weights[12])
        self.bd = weights[13]

        input_size = len(self.W1[0])
        self.hidden1 = len(self.b1) // 4
        self.hidden2 = len(self.b2) // 4
        self.hidden3 = len(self.b3) // 4
        self.hidden4 = len(self.b4) // 4

        self.lstm1 = LSTMCell(input_size, self.hidden1, self.W1, self.U1, self.b1)
        self.lstm2 = LSTMCell(self.hidden1, self.hidden2, self.W2, self.U2, self.b2)
        self.lstm3 = LSTMCell(self.hidden2, self.hidden3, self.W3, self.U3, self.b3)
        self.lstm4 = LSTMCell(self.hidden3, self.hidden4, self.W4, self.U4, self.b4)
        self.dense = Dense(self.Wd, self.bd)
```

‚úÖ After applying this fix:

    You should see h1/h2 with non-zero values.

    vector_tanh should now be called with valid (non-empty) inputs.

    Your inference quality should improve ‚Äî this should restore expected behavior.

Let me know if you'd like to verify some reconstructed output or check if the fixed-point ranges need updating after this correction.

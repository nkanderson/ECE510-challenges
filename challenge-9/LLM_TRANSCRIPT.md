### Performance Estimate

<Continued from thread on algorithm design, shifting into hardware discussion>

Prompt: What would be a good way to estimate how much data needs to be transferred from the CPU to this hypothetical hardware (in the form of a chiplet) if it were to implement the step function?

Response: That’s a very sharp and important question — estimating data transfer volume between the CPU and your hypothetical LSTM chiplet accelerator is crucial for evaluating performance, latency, and bandwidth needs.

Let’s walk through how to estimate data movement for step() per inference sequence.

✅ 1. Understand What step() Needs per Call

Let’s assume we’re implementing this on a chiplet that executes one LSTMCell.step() per clock cycle, and the host CPU sends data for each sequence window.

For each step(x, h_prev, c_prev), the chiplet needs:
🔹 Inputs:

    x: input vector → size input_size

    h_prev: hidden vector → size hidden_size

    c_prev: cell state → size hidden_size

    W and U matrices → constant weights (unless streaming)

    b bias vectors → constant

🔹 Outputs:

    h: updated hidden state → hidden_size

    c: updated cell state → hidden_size

🧮 2. Estimate Data per Step

Assume:

    input_size = M

    hidden_size = N

    All values are 32-bit floats (4 bytes)

Component | Count | Bytes
x | M | 4 * M
h_prev | N | 4 * N
c_prev | N | 4 * N
h + c | 2 × N | 2 * 4 * N = 8 * N
Total I/O |  | 4 * M + 12 * N bytes

If M = 6, N = 32 (your actual model):

    Input: 4×6 + 4×32 + 4×32 = 552 bytes

    Output: 4×32 + 4×32 = 256 bytes

    Total per step = 808 bytes

🌀 3. Total for One Window

For a sequence of length T = 24:

    Total per LSTM layer: 24 × 808 = 19.2 KB

    Your encoder has 2 LSTM layers, and decoder has 2 more

    Approx total data exchanged = 4 × 19.2 KB ≈ 76.8 KB per sequence

This is per forward pass — if doing backpropagation (for training), this would double or triple.

🚀 Chiplet Optimization Notes

If the chiplet:

    Holds weights (W, U, b) locally in SRAM → no transfer needed

    Chains layers internally (LSTM1 → LSTM2) → you save intermediate transfers

    Implements on-chip h/c buffering → only stream x in and h out

Best-Case Streamed Input:

    Just send x per timestep, receive h

    ~24 × (input_size + hidden_size) × 4 = much smaller

🛠️ What You Can Do Next

    Want a breakdown of chiplet SRAM usage for storing weights?

    Want to evaluate latency per step if implemented in SystemVerilog with N-cycle MACs?

    Or begin defining interfaces between the CPU and chiplet (e.g., AXI/streaming model)?

Let me know how you want to proceed — performance modeling, interface sketching, or HDL design.

Prompt: Let's start with point 2, evaluating latency per step, though I need additional explanation on N-cycle MACs. Let's assume for now that we will be storing weights in SRAM. So I want to estimate the latency due to data transfer to the chip and back for each individual call to the step function, then use that as the basis for estimating the total time taken for step functionality if using this chiplet and communicating over PCIe

Response: Perfect — you're narrowing in on the core of what performance looks like for a hardware LSTM accelerator over PCIe. We’ll walk through:
✅ Step-by-Step Plan

    Understand N-cycle MACs

    Estimate latency for one step() execution

    Add PCIe transfer time per call

    Estimate total sequence latency over PCIe

🧠 1. What Are N-cycle MACs?

A MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) unit computes:

```
acc += a * b
```

In FPGA/ASIC design:

    A 1-cycle MAC performs a*b + acc in one clock cycle.

    An N-cycle MAC is pipelined or shared:

        Each output takes N cycles.

        Multiple MACs can be time-multiplexed to save area.

In our case:

    matvec_mul → inner product: sum of M a*b terms

    We assume N = M for full sequential MAC; or fewer if pipelined

So if you do one dot product of length M, and only have one MAC unit:

    It takes M cycles.

If you have P MACs in parallel, it takes M / P cycles (rounded up).

🧮 2. Latency for One step() (no transfer yet)
One step() includes:

    8 matvec_mul calls (for 4 gates × Wx and Uh)

    4 elementwise_add (bias and matvec outputs)

    4 activation functions (sigmoid/tanh)

    2 elementwise_mul and 2 elementwise_add for c, h

Let’s assume:

    input_size = 6, hidden_size = 32

    One MAC unit per dot product (worst case): takes 6 or 32 cycles

    Other operations are negligible or pipelined

Operation | Count | Latency each | Total cycles
matvec_mul Wx | 4 | 6 | 24
matvec_mul Uh | 4 | 32 | 128
Adds / biases | 4 | 1 | 4
Activations | 4 | ~4 (LUT) | 16
elementwise_mul/add (c, h) | ~6 | 1 | 6
Total |  |  | ~178

So: ~178 clock cycles per step call, assuming 1 MAC at a time
If fully parallelized: much faster (~1–4 cycles), but that’s area-expensive.

Let’s proceed with 178 cycles at 200 MHz clock:

    1 cycle = 5 ns → 178 cycles ≈ 890 ns

🚛 3. Add PCIe Transfer Time

We previously estimated ~808 bytes transferred per step() (input + output).
PCIe Gen4 x4 (realistic desktop scenario):

    Theoretical: ~8 GB/s

    Realistic sustained: ~4–6 GB/s

    Latency: 500 ns–1.5 µs (depends on batch size and DMA overhead)

So:

    808 bytes / 5 GB/s ≈ 161 ns

    Add PCIe latency overhead (~500 ns)

→ Transfer latency per step ≈ 660 ns

⏱️ 4. Total Time per Step over PCIe

Component | Time
Data transfer | ~660 ns
Compute time | ~890 ns
Total | ~1.55 µs

📊 Final Estimate per Sequence

For T = 24 steps:

    One LSTM layer: 24 × 1.55 µs = ~37 µs

    Four layers (as in your model): ~150 µs per sequence

That’s ~6,666 sequences/sec sustained throughput per chiplet
(excluding batching or overlapping optimizations)

🔜 What You Can Do Next

    Want to look at overlapping data transfer + compute using pipelined architecture?

    Want to explore how many parallel MACs would bring latency under 10 µs?

    Or sketch the SystemVerilog interface with timing diagram over PCIe?

Let’s dig into whichever direction you want to optimize for — latency, throughput, or integration.
